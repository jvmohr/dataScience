      "Leela: It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancÃ© now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ... [She repeatedly looks at Farnsworth, Zoidberg and Fry, makes a quick decision, then pulls Fry forward.] Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.\n",

      "Bender: I was just about to suggest the same thing. [The Countess giggles then disappears into the bathroom. The sound of a power tool comes from the room. Bender rubs his hands with glee. He rummages through her drawers and sees a bracelet on the table. He picks it up and chuckles.] Pay dirt!\n",
      "Countess: Lovely, isn't it?\n",
      "Bender: Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.\n",
      "Countess: Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!\n",
      "Bender: I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?\n",
      "iZac: It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love.\n",

      "Hattie: I like a man who's flexible!\n",

      "Leela: But I didn't even limbo.\n",
      "Zapp: No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening.\n",
      "Bender: Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.\n",
      "Countess: Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator.\n",
      "Bender: You do? Really?\n",
      "Zapp: I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.\n",
      "Fry: Thank you, sir.\n",
      "Zapp: As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.\n",
      "Fry: Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.\n",
      "Amy: Hey, Fry.\n",
      "Leela: Amy!\n",

      "Leela: [whispering] What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.\n",
      "Fry: [whispering] Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.\n",
      "Zapp: I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!\n",
      "Mrs. Wong: Hear, hear! Now let's have a kiss!\n",
      "Zapp: Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.\n",
      "Fry: Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--\n",
      "Mr. Wong: What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!\n",
      "Farnsworth: Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?\n",

      "Kif: Captain, may I have a word with you?\n",
      "Zapp: No.\n",
      "Kif: It's an emergency, sir.\n",

      "Amy: Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss.\n",
      "Fry: Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.\n",
      "Kif: Sir, remember your course correction?\n",
      "Zapp: No.\n",
      "Kif: Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.\n",
      "Zapp: Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more: Your cowardice or your stupidity! We'll simply set a new course for that empty region over there. Near that black-ish hole-ish thing.\n",
      "Fry: Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?\n",
      "Leela: I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.\n",
      "Fry: Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.\n",
      "Leela: Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.\n",
      "Fry: I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.\n",
      "Leela: Nice nebula.\n",
      "Fry: Yeah.\n",
      "Leela: Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.\n",
      "Fry: And me.\n",
      "Leela: What was that? [She looks over the railings and sees.] Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.\n",
      "Fry: Talk about a mood killer!\n",
      "Zapp: Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship.\n",
      "Kif: Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.\n",
      "Zapp: No, it's noble of you, Kif! [He tears his captain's patch off.] As of now ... [He puts the patch on Kif.] ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!\n",
      "Leela: OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.\n",
      "Farnsworth: [shouting] I'm too young to die!\n",
      "Leela: Come on, before it's too late!\n",
      "Bender: You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.\n",
      "Fry: You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?\n",
      "Bender: [whispering] Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.\n",
      "Fry: I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.\n",
      "Bender: I love you, buddy!\n",
      "Bender: [shouting] Countess? Countess?\n",
      "Countess: [shouting] Bender!\n",
      "Countess: [shouting] I fell through the deck.\n",
      "Bender: [shouting] Are you hurt, my sweet?\n",
      "Countess: [shouting] No. Luckily a family broke my fall.\n",
      "Bender: Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!\n",
      "Countess: Bender, you risked your life to save me.\n",
      "Bender: And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it. [They kiss.] When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.\n",
      "Leela: Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!\n",
      "Hermes: [gasping] Faster!\n",
      "Leela: It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.\n",
      "Fry: Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!\n",
      "Hermes: No one, except a legendary limbo champion.\n",
      "LaBarbara: Oh, Hermes!\n",
      "Hermes: Ooh! It's been a while. [He leans back and tries to go under the door. His knees hit it.] This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.\n",
      "LaBarbara: That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!\n",
      "Hermes: I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.\n",
      "LaBarbara: Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!\n",
      "Hermes: Yes, dear.\n",
      "LaBarbara: That's my man!\n",
      "Amy: Yay, Hermes!\n",
      "Hermes: Uh, can somebody help me up?\n",
      "Countess: Well, now what are we going to do?\n",
      "Bender: Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?\n",
      "Countess: By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.\n",
      "Farnsworth: Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.\n",
      "Leela: We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.\n",
      "Mrs. Wong: Amy!\n",
      "Amy: Mom? Dad? You're alive!\n",
      "Mr. Wong: Yeah, but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man.\n",
      "Mrs. Wong: A captain.\n",
      "Amy: Uh, Mom, I don't-- [Enter Kif.] Hi!\n",
      "Kif: [sexfully] Hello!\n",
      "Farnsworth: I don't feel well!\n",
      "Fry: Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost-- [The nebula is sucked into the black hole.] Never mind!\n",
      "Hermes: Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?\n",
      "Leela: I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.\n",
      "Fry: Goodbye, Bender.\n",
      "Bender: [shouting] Wait for us!\n",
      "Leela: Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.\n",
      "Amy: Well, it's not me!\n",
      "Fry: Look!\n",
      "Countess: I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!\n",
      "Bender: I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!\n",
      "Countess: No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.\n",
      "Bender: Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.\n",
      "Countess: [shouting] Farewell!\n",
      "Bender: [shouting] No!\n",
      "Bender: She's gone.\n",
      "Leela: But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.\n",
      "Fry: Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?\n",
      "Farnsworth: Oh, yes, absolutely! [He turns to Zoidberg.] Not a chance!\n",
      "Bender: At least I'll always have her bracelet! [He hands it to Hermes.] What do you think it's worth?\n",
